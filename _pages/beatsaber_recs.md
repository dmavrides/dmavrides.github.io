<a href="https://bsaber.com/songs/new/?bookmarked_by=18dylan18">Here's</a> a complete list of my Beatsaber bookmarks on bsaber.com. 
If you have Beatsaber but don't yet have it modded to enable custom songs, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST7OhRngLIA&ab_channel=Naysy">here's</a> a video tutorial, and <a href="https://bsaber.com/installing-the-mod-guide-necessary-for-any-custom-songs/">here's</a> a text tutorial on how to do so. 
Once you have that set up, you can go to my bookmarks page and just add songs of your choosing. Those aren't all great, but it should include all of my recs below.
