Please send me recommendations of your own!

Some of the recs here are a little niche, or rely on context/knowledge from various domains. I may try to more clearly label these in the future.

## Games
### Video Games
* Baba Is You - Puzzle Game
* BeatSaber - Guitar Hero but in VR
* Celeste - Cute platformer with good music, calming & optimistic vibes.
* Storybook Brawl - Auto battler that I personally enjoy
* Lichess.org over Chess.com

### Social Games
* <a href="http://www.persondothing.com/howto.html">Person do thing</a> - More-constrained taboo. Playing this game feels similar to being in an intro language class where your professor has banned English, but fun.
* <a href="https://spyfall.tannerkrewson.com/">Spyfall</a> - Social deduction game. I prefer to play where everyone answers questions as if you're just you, instead of role-playing.
* <a href="https://www.brokenpicturephone.com/">Broken Picturephone</a> - This game is fun to play in person with real paper/pens, or online here over discord or zoom or wherever.
* <a href="https://drawbattle.io/">drawbattle.io</a> - Basically online (team) pictionary
* <a href="https://skribbl.io/">skribbl.io</a> - Basically online (ffa) pictionary

### Board/Card Games
* <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/liars-poker">Liars' Poker</a> - A card game that doesn't have betting rounds. I normally play the game starting with only 1 card, I don't use rule 5 in his list, and use more-correct probabilistic distribution of hands (by eliminating flushes with greater than 5 cards, the rest is ltr). Some people prefer to start with 5-7 cards and count down to 0, but I like the rebalancing-nature of the first version.
* Magic Maze - A fun cooperative board game; decent to play with friends who don't often play board games.
* Hanabi - A cooperative card game that I think is really fun. Think a cross between bridge and <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a26557/riddle-of-the-week-27-blue-eyed-islanders/">the blue-eyed islanders puzzle</a>. <a href="https://hanabi.github.io/">Here's</a> a place to learn some conventions, although many of them can be deduced if you think really hard. You can buy cards or <a href="https://hanab.live/">play online</a>.
* <a href="https://dominion.games/">Dominion</a> - Classic deck-building game

**Pattern-recognition-based Games**
* <a href="http://www.bananagrammer.com/2009/07/game-of-snatch-aka-anagrams.html">Anagrams/Mongoose/Snatch</a> - I prefer variants of this game to the more-popular bananagrams (although that's also a fine game). I personally prefer to play allowing words to be stolen without adding any letters (but a word can't be arranged back to a prior-formed word with the same tiles).
* Set
* <a href="https://www.mathcamp.org/2015/proset/">Proset/Projective Set</a> - A variant of set.  
* <a href="https://www.pagat.com/adders/24.html">24</a> - A game where you practice mental-arithmetic. I prefer to leave in face cards as 11,12,13, although this does mean you'll have more 'no solution' combinations.
* Spot It/Dobble - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTDKqW_GLkw&ab_channel=Stand-upMaths">Here's</a> a nice video by Matt Parker on the math behind the game, and how there's a couple cards missing!

**Other board games I like sometimes**
* 7 Wonders
* Splendor
* Azul

* Bughouse - team chess; admittedly the set of people for whom this is a good rec, and who also haven't played it is probably empty

## TV Shows
I often watch TV shows (or listen to them using Netflix audio descriptions) while doing other things.
### Comedy
* Brooklyn Nine-Nine - If you like sitcoms, this should be at the top of your list.
* Nathan for you/The Rehearsal - Two of my favorite shows on this page. In the former, Nathan Fielder gives 'unorthodox' marketing ideas to small businesses. The latter is a ride of it's own.
* Bojack Horseman - Dark, depressing, witty satire. 
* Crazy Ex-Girlfriend - A lighthearted musical romcom/satire. The musical element to the show works surprisingly well.
* 30 Rock - A lighthearted sitcom by Tina Fey and Donald Glover.
* Ted Lasso - My favorite currently-running sitcom. Jason Sudeikis is well-revered American football coach who's hired to be manager of a British football (soccer) team.
* Schitt's Creek - lighthearted sitcom/drama. I didn't love this show as much as some people, but for people who are big into sitcoms like modern family, friends, and the like; this is one of the better recent ones IMO.

* How To with John Wilson - Executive Produced by Nathan Fielder, similar-ish in style to the other two shows.

### Drama
* Master of None - A romantic comedy drama. I really love this show (at least seasons 1-2); give it a try if you're looking for something lighthearted.
* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul - Both dark, but very engaging. If you've seen Breaking Bad and liked it but haven't tried Better Call Saul, you should.
* The Queen's Gambit - Coming-of-age/historical drama. I'm biased here, but hard to argue with the 96% on Rotten Tomatoes. The scenary in the show is particularly entrancing. Some small overdramatizations when it comes to the chess, but not as egregious as most media of its kind.
* Atlanta - Cerebral drama. Donald Glover is a manager for his cousin trying to make it in the Atlanta rap game. This show certainly tries to do a lot; I won't say much more, but it certainly takes you for a (progressively trippier) ride.
* Barry - dark comedy drama. Bill Hader is a depressed hitman who ends up taking acting classes.
* Patriot - dark comedy drama. John is a depressed but competent undercover agent. 
* Fleabag - dry comedy drama. If you like british comedy, this is a short series you'll probably enjoy.
* The Leftovers - sci-fi drama. I've seen a lot of sci-fi/dystopian dramas and this was definitely one of the better ones. Took me a couple episodes to get into it.
* Game of Thrones - I waited until the last season was airing to watch this show, so I wasn't very excited for it. I think that it wasn't really my type of show, but I still liked it. If you've held out watching it and don't mind some blood/gore, there's a reason why it was everywhere for 8 years.
* House of Cards - An intricate political drama. One of those shows where if you pay attention, there are some big payoffs. I think the first couple seasons are the best. No longer a Spacey fan, this is just a rec for the show.
* Community - A classic sitcom. If you're a sitcom person and you like other sitcoms on this list, here you go.

### Action/Adventure
* Daredevil - I watched the MCU shows so you don't have to. This is the best one; if you need to watch one more, I'd recommend Jessica Jones.
* Legion - Okay this is a psychological thriller, but still a superhero series! I don't remember much about this show to be honest, but I wrote it on my recs list so if you want a superhero show it's probably not a bad pick.
* Avatar the last Airbender/The Legend of Korra - Fantasy coming-of-age stories. If you like Avatar as a kid, Legend of Korra is similar but for slightly older audiences, and I enjoyed it a couple of years ago.
* Stranger Things - sci-fi drama; I'm sure you've heard of it, but I'm listing it here anyway. Breakfast Club vibes.

### Other
* Black Mirror - Cerebral Anthology series. The episodes vary a lot in quality, in my opinion. I would start out with *White Christmas*, *Hated in the Nation*, and *San Junipero*.
* McMillion$ - True docu-series about how the McDonald's Monopoly promotion was rigged by the mob
* Chernobyl - Historical drama based on true events surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear disaster. Not framed as a docu-series, as engaging as any fictional drama. Highly critically-acclaimed.
* The Final Table - A cooking show with terrible reviews (? I didn't know this until I looked it up just now). I don't normally like/watch cooking shows, but I liked this one when I watched it. Maybe I just have bad taste...

**Other shows I've enjoyed but for various reasons wouldn't go so far as to recommend**

Sometimes grouped roughly by genre, but only kind of
* The Office (US/UK), Parks and Recreation, The Good Place, Silicon Valley, The IT Crowd, Sneaky Pete, How I Met Your Mother
* The Boys, The Handmaid's tale, The Walking Dead (first few seasons), The End of the F\*\*\*ing World, American Horror Story (seasons 1-3)
* Doctor Who, Sherlock, Firefly
* Rick and Morty
* Dahmer
* Death Note, Attack on Titan
* Squid Game
* Without a Recipe Roadtrip
* The Strongest Man in History
* Mythbusters
* Taskmaster

## YouTube Channels/Videos
Most of the channels I list here are good even if the content I describe doesn't sound interesting; consider giving them a try even if the description doesn't excite you. (Except some of the math/chess/climbing ones are a bit niche/I admit I'm biased here, so it's harder to tell.)
* Weird Explorer - Guy travels the world trying every kind of fruit he can find. I don't eat much fruit but love this channel anyway. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqicsIDYmgU&list=PLvGFkMrO1ZxJR98H4XiJP5ABIzdmx136n&ab_channel=WeirdExplorer">Coco de Mer: My Hunt for the Tree of Knowledge</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agnuTbXuXu0&ab_channel=WeirdExplorer">Cloudberry: My Hunt For One Of The World's Most Elusive Fruits</a>

Also sometimes tries to deduce where photos were taken from just the image and the internet. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7w986ni7_g&t=336s&ab_channel=GeoWizard">I attempted to cross an entire country in a straight line.</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-5J0kL7aRs&t=1s&ab_channel=GeoWizard">Can I pinpoint the EXACT location of my fans using a single image?</a>

* Nick Bostrom - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnT1xgZgkpk&ab_channel=TED">What happens when our computers get smarter than we are?</a> If you haven't been given a spiel about the importance of AI safety, this isn't a bad place to start; it was the first exposure I had to any of the arguments, back in 2015. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0Nf3TcMiHo&ab_channel=TEDxTalks">The end of humanity</a> Similar to the previous video, but for existential risk/transhumanist ideas. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlftshhkO4k&ab_channel=Science%2CTechnology%26theFuture">Simulation Argument</a> Presents his relatively convincing argument that we live in a simulation.
* bill wurtz - Honestly, I'm basically just recommending a single video here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuCn8ux2gbs&t=287s&ab_channel=billwurtz">history of the entire world, i guess<a/>
* Tom Scott - informative videos about the world. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef93WmlEho0&ab_channel=TomScott">Why California's musical road sounds terrible<a/>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxV14h0kFs0&ab_channel=TomScott">This Video Has 60,141,727 Views</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NzVmtbPOrM&ab_channel=TomScott">I can't show you how pink this pink is.<a/>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYj3DnI81AQ&ab_channel=TomScott">Ten years ago, I predicted 2022. Did I get it right?</a>
* Channel 5/All Gas No Brakes - Andrew Callaghan is a video journalist who travels in a van and interviews people. Sometimes serious situations, sometimes right-wing meetups, sometimes just drunk partygoers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H110vCGvTmM&ab_channel=AllGasNoBrakes">Flat Earth Conference</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZPeD2miyF8&ab_channel=AllGasNoBrakes">Minneapolis Protest</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9v6q5YzbGA&t=203s&ab_channel=Channel5withAndrewCallaghan">Hollywood Antivax Rally</a>

* Insights into Mathematics - I recommend this channel specifically because it has a very accessible and entertaining <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW8Cy6WrO94&list=PL55C7C83781CF4316&ab_channel=InsightsintoMathematics">history of mathematics video series.</a> He argues that introducing mathematics by motivating it in the way people were motivated historically - by chronological incremental progress, and specific interesting problems that required new methods to solve - is a better way to keep attention and understand why various fields are important and how they relate to each other. I found this much more intuitive than the traditional method (going through random topics like calculus and linear algebra, building up formal math via set theory and constructing the reals etc.)
* Two Minute Papers - Keeping you up to date on advancements in AI, summarizing recent papers and showing examples. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y1-KlTEmwk&t=24s&ab_channel=TwoMinutePapers">Google's New AI: Fly INTO Photos!</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyOW6fmkgrc&t=5s&ab_channel=TwoMinutePapers">Google's Imagen AI: Outrageously Good!</a>

* Geek Climber - "Average Guy" learns various calisthetics/gives himself climbing challenges. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuA-BpWBtc&ab_channel=GeekClimber">This Average Guy Learns the Handstand in 156 days</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj4h6XrizJA&ab_channel=GeekClimber">Guy Who Can't Jump Trains 30 Days to Improve His Vertical</a>
* Rare Earth - Traveler narrates interesting stories from history. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOGuZnYY_2w&ab_channel=RareEarth">When 2000lbs of Cocaine Washed Up in a Small Town</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BIA4dgAJ9A&t=878s&ab_channel=RareEarth">The CIA's Secret Genocide in Guatemala</a>

* Soft White Underbelly - Videographer interviews drug users, criminals, and various other people who live on the edge of society. (Insert content warnings of basically every kind.) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6igTJXcqvo&ab_channel=SoftWhiteUnderbelly">Hacker Interview-Gummo</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9Z1uTX7z58&ab_channel=SoftWhiteUnderbelly">Functional Heroin Addict interview-Matthew</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DfGSeylQ5o&t=859s&ab_channel=SoftWhiteUnderbelly">Shooting Victim-Jerry</a>

* Cracking the Cryptic - Two british sudoku/puzzling champs go through 'Cryptic Sudokus' with you. These puzzles are basically sudoku puzzles with extra rules that vary by puzzle. A good way to watch these is to click the link in the description, try the puzzle yourself, and then watch the video whenever you get stuck (which may be frequent!) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAyZ9K2EBF0&t=3s&ab_channel=CrackingTheCryptic">A Sudoku With Only 4 Given Digits?!</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX5WPYbT_AU&ab_channel=CrackingTheCryptic">The Best "Easy" Puzzle...But How Fast Can You Solve It?!?</a>
