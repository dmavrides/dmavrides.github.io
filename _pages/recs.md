<a href="https://dmavrides.github.io/_pages/recs/#write-things-down">This</a> is the most important recommendation on this page. 

<a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQB1S_bZYqjzyry9MGHrEFXUCUjddg33R">Here's a YouTube playlist</a> containing a couple videos from some of of my favorite channels (described below). There's also <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2DLYSie9MNjxxqJYwub1ct">this Spotify playlist</a> with a selected variety of music/artists I like.

## YouTube Channels/Videos
If you just want the videos, <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQB1S_bZYqjzyry9MGHrEFXUCUjddg33R">here's a youTube playlist</a> I made that's (probably mostly) synced with the below recs list. <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQB1S_bZYqjxOqsXi68qX_QeFJgPmYA-z">Here's</a> a playlist with videos I might add to the original list, but haven't yet added.

Most of the channels I list here are good even if the content I describe doesn't sound interesting; consider giving them a try even if the description doesn't excite you. (Except some of the math/chess/climbing ones are a bit niche/I admit I'm biased here, so it's harder to tell.)
* Weird Explorer - Guy travels the world trying every kind of fruit he can find. I don't eat much fruit but love this channel anyway. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqicsIDYmgU&list=PLvGFkMrO1ZxJR98H4XiJP5ABIzdmx136n&ab_channel=WeirdExplorer">Coco de Mer: My Hunt for the Tree of Knowledge</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agnuTbXuXu0&ab_channel=WeirdExplorer">Cloudberry: My Hunt For One Of The World's Most Elusive Fruits</a>

* GeoWizard - Man tries to cross countries in a perfectly straight line. Also sometimes tries to deduce where photos were taken from just the image and the internet. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7w986ni7_g&t=336s&ab_channel=GeoWizard">I attempted to cross an entire country in a straight line.</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-5J0kL7aRs&t=1s&ab_channel=GeoWizard">Can I pinpoint the EXACT location of my fans using a single image?</a>

* Tom Scott - informative videos about the world. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef93WmlEho0&ab_channel=TomScott">Why California's musical road sounds terrible<a/>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxV14h0kFs0&ab_channel=TomScott">This Video Has 60,141,727 Views</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NzVmtbPOrM&ab_channel=TomScott">I can't show you how pink this pink is.<a/>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYj3DnI81AQ&ab_channel=TomScott">Ten years ago, I predicted 2022. Did I get it right?</a>
* Johnny Harris - Has a couple great pieces of investigative video journalism. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrDEtSlqJC4&ab_channel=JohnnyHarris">The REAL Reason McDonalds Ice Cream Machines Are Always Broken</a> is really fantastic work.
* YMS - Did you hear about how _The Lion King_ ripped off the japanese manga/animated TV series _Kimba the White Lion_? There are a number of striking similarities that caused a stir on the internet a few years ago. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5B1mIfQuo4&ab_channel=YourMovieSucksDOTorg>YMS does a deep-dive on the topic,</a> showing conclusively how this controvery was a classic story of overfitting, confirmation bias, and people on the internet not doing their due diligence.
* Channel 5/All Gas No Brakes - Andrew Callaghan is a video journalist who travels in a van and interviews people. Sometimes serious situations, sometimes right-wing meetups, sometimes just drunk partygoers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H110vCGvTmM&ab_channel=AllGasNoBrakes">Flat Earth Conference</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZPeD2miyF8&ab_channel=AllGasNoBrakes">Minneapolis Protest</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9v6q5YzbGA&t=203s&ab_channel=Channel5withAndrewCallaghan">Hollywood Antivax Rally</a>
* Thunk - Introductions to topics in philosophy and reasoning. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu2mT1KIOHM&t=2s&ab_channel=THUNK">115. The Motte & Bailey Fallacy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqjZqzM3rqg&t=217s&ab_channel=THUNK">42. The Meaning of Life, the Universe, & Everything</a>

This Is What Happened To Her Brain.</a>
* Insights into Mathematics - I recommend this channel specifically because it has a very accessible and entertaining <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW8Cy6WrO94&list=PL55C7C83781CF4316&ab_channel=InsightsintoMathematics">history of mathematics video series.</a> He argues that introducing mathematics by motivating it in the way people were motivated historically - by chronological incremental progress, and specific interesting problems that required new methods to solve - is a better way to keep attention and understand why various fields are important and how they relate to each other. I found this much more intuitive than the traditional method (going through random topics like calculus and linear algebra, building up formal math via set theory and constructing the reals etc.)
* Two Minute Papers - Keeping you up to date on advancements in AI, summarizing recent papers and showing examples. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y1-KlTEmwk&t=24s&ab_channel=TwoMinutePapers">Google's New AI: Fly INTO Photos!</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyOW6fmkgrc&t=5s&ab_channel=TwoMinutePapers">Google's Imagen AI: Outrageously Good!</a>

* Geek Climber - "Average Guy" learns various calisthetics/gives himself climbing challenges. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuA-BpWBtc&ab_channel=GeekClimber">This Average Guy Learns the Handstand in 156 days</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj4h6XrizJA&ab_channel=GeekClimber">Guy Who Can't Jump Trains 30 Days to Improve His Vertical</a>

* Steve Mould - Explanations of scientific phenomena. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkaJ6iK2CJc&t=642s&ab_channel=SteveMould">I Can Twist My Eye Around Its Pupil (And So Can You)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg73j3QYRJc&t=115s&ab_channel=SteveMould">The Spring Paradox</a>
* Soft White Underbelly - Videographer interviews drug users, criminals, and various other people who live on the edge of society. (Insert content warnings of basically every kind.) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6igTJXcqvo&ab_channel=SoftWhiteUnderbelly">Hacker Interview-Gummo</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9Z1uTX7z58&ab_channel=SoftWhiteUnderbelly">Functional Heroin Addict interview-Matthew</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DfGSeylQ5o&t=859s&ab_channel=SoftWhiteUnderbelly">Shooting Victim-Jerry</a>
* The Try Guys - Lighthearted videos of ~4 guys trying to do various things. In particular, I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4Uuxg6jmbo&list=PL9qQXSjI-WOqgtYxpBlrJn8d__xzzb8mN&ab_channel=BuzzFeedVideo">Without A Recipe</a>

* Cracking the Cryptic - Two british sudoku/puzzling champs go through 'Cryptic Sudokus' with you. These puzzles are basically sudoku puzzles with extra rules that vary by puzzle. A good way to watch these is to click the link in the description, try the puzzle yourself, and then watch the video whenever you get stuck (which may be frequent!) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAyZ9K2EBF0&t=3s&ab_channel=CrackingTheCryptic">A Sudoku With Only 4 Given Digits?!</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX5WPYbT_AU&ab_channel=CrackingTheCryptic">The Best "Easy" Puzzle...But How Fast Can You Solve It?!?</a>
* Numberphile - popular math videos. I like their interviews, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrJCm10ajJw&ab_channel=Numberphile2">this interview</a> on Numberphile 2 with Tadashi Tokeida about his life (originally a linguist and painter, now a stanford math professor!), and <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjVDqfUhXOY&t=5s&ab_channel=Numberphile">Billionaire Mathematician</a> with Jim Simons.

## Movies
### Cerebral/Thriller
* Parasite - A poor family Korean family concocts a scheme to con a wealthy family. First non-English-language film to win the Oscar for Best Picture.
* Memento - A Christopher Nolan nonlinear-mystery where the main man has anterograde amnesia.
* Ex Machina - This Bladerunner-esque film explores artificial intelligence and what it means to be human.
* Mr. Nobody - Tells the life-story of the last mortal man on earth.
* Bandersnatch - A literal choose-your-own adventure Black Mirror movie on Netflix. 
* The Truman Show - A man is unaware that he lives inside of an elaborate TV set, broadcasting his life.
* Fight Club - A film that seems to be about siezing the day, but evolves into something more complicated.
* Nightcrawler - About a man who stumbles into a career as a crime photographer. Not a traditional horror movie, but I remember thinking this was a terrifying film when I saw it.
* Inception - A Christopher Nolan film about living your dreams - or, somebody else's? Leonardo DiCaprio fails to win an Oscar, but nevertheless puts on a good show.
* Shutter Island - A mystery where Leonardo DiCaprio (once again, failing to win an Oscar) is a U.S. Marshall investigating an escape from a high-security insane asylum.
* Predestination - Takes you for an even wilder ride than most movies on my list. Not very well-known/criminally underrated in my opinion.
* Interstellar - Humanity is running low on resources and scientists make plans to explore space in the hopes of finding another habitable planet. Another Christopher Nolan film. 
* Snowpiercer - Set in a post-apocalyptic world where the only remnants of humanity live in a class-divided luxury train continually circumnavigating the world. By the same director as Parasite. 
  
### Other
* Inside by Bo Burnham - Comedian Bo Burnham shoots and performs a comedy special alone during the first year of covid. I watched this right as I finally interacted with people again after a year and it was cathartic. He stepped up his music-game and matured a lot since his previous content.
* Submarine - British coming-of-age comedy drama. A little off-beat, with the satific/dry humor that I often enjoy. Haven't seen it for a while but I remember enjoying the movie enough to add to the list.
* The Intouchables - feel good comedy/drama based on a true story about a wealthy quadriplegic who hires an ex-con to be his caretaker. This was the most-viewed French film for a few years after its release.
* Forrest Gump - If you still haven't seen this drama/romance movie from the 90s, it's never too late
* La La Land - musical drama/romance; music is great, movie itself is also good
* Perks of being a Wallflower - if you were a socially awkward teen, you might like this coming-of-age drama. I watched it a while ago, so take it up with past-Dylan if it doesn't hold up
* A Star is Born - Stars Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. Good music, romantic drama. Not normally my type of movie, watched it on a long flight and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.
* Marriage Story - A depiction of the difficulties of balancing family and a career + a modern depiction of divorce that held my attention for the whole movie.
* Shawshank Redemption - considered by some to be the greatest film ever, if you've forgotten to watch it, this is your reminder
* Pulp Fiction - speaking of films that some consider to be the greatest; I put off this one for a while, assuming it was overhyped by film buffs and the sort of movie you pretended to like to fit in with them.
* Hamilton - speaking of films that some consider to be the greatest; if you're never going to cough up the money to see the broadway show for Hamilton, the Disney recording of the production is pretty good.
* Schindler's List - The best movie I watched at school. The music by John Williams performed by Perlman is also heart-wrenchingly beautiful.
* The Martian - Sci-fi/action. A rare case where the movie is purportedly better than the book. Matt Damon is stuck on Mars after a disaster and tries to survive. Interesting uses of science and just a good movie.
* Free Solo - Movie about Alex Honnald, a rock climber who wants to 'Free Solo' the most spectacular rock-climbing route in the world; a mountain face in Yellowstone called El Capitan.

* I'm a longtime fan of Streetlight Manifesto, and spin-offs Toh Kay and BOTAR. but have a lot of variety in what I listen to.

## Books etc.
* The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss - If you enjoy fantasy, I'd give it a read
* <a href = "https://unsongbook.com/">Unsong</a> by Scott Alexander - A quirky sci-fi novel with a soft-spot for wordplay. 
* <a href="http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/1">HPMOR</a> - Some people don't care for it, some people think it's the best thing they've ever read. If you identified the most with Hermione in Harry Potter, and can tolerate occasional severe cringe, give it a try.

## Games
### Video Games
* Baba Is You - Puzzle Game
* BeatSaber - Guitar Hero but in VR
* Celeste - Cute platformer with good music, calming & optimistic vibes.
* Storybook Brawl - Auto battler that I personally enjoy
* Lichess.org over Chess.com

### Social Games
* <a href="http://www.persondothing.com/howto.html">Person do thing</a> - More-constrained taboo. Playing this game feels similar to being in an intro language class where your professor has banned English, but fun.
* <a href="https://spyfall.tannerkrewson.com/">Spyfall</a> - Social deduction game. I prefer to play where everyone answers questions as if you're just you, instead of role-playing.
* <a href="https://www.brokenpicturephone.com/">Broken Picturephone</a> - This game is fun to play in person with real paper/pens, or online here over discord or zoom or wherever.
* <a href="https://drawbattle.io/">drawbattle.io</a> - Basically online (team) pictionary
* <a href="https://skribbl.io/">skribbl.io</a> - Basically online (ffa) pictionary

### Board/Card Games
* <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/liars-poker">Liars' Poker</a> - A card game that doesn't have betting rounds. I normally play the game starting with only 1 card, I don't use rule 5 in his list, and use more-correct probabilistic distribution of hands (by eliminating flushes with greater than 5 cards, the rest is ltr). Some people prefer to start with 5-7 cards and count down to 0, but I like the rebalancing-nature of the first version.
* Magic Maze - A fun cooperative board game; decent to play with friends who don't often play board games.
* Hanabi - A cooperative card game that I think is really fun. Think a cross between bridge and <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a26557/riddle-of-the-week-27-blue-eyed-islanders/">the blue-eyed islanders puzzle</a>. <a href="https://hanabi.github.io/">Here's</a> a place to learn some conventions, although many of them can be deduced if you think really hard. You can buy cards or <a href="https://hanab.live/">play online</a>.
* <a href="https://dominion.games/">Dominion</a> - Classic deck-building game

**Pattern-recognition-based Games**
* <a href="http://www.bananagrammer.com/2009/07/game-of-snatch-aka-anagrams.html">Anagrams/Mongoose/Snatch</a> - I prefer variants of this game to the more-popular bananagrams (although that's also a fine game). I personally prefer to play allowing words to be stolen without adding any letters (but a word can't be arranged back to a prior-formed word with the same tiles).
* Set
* <a href="https://www.mathcamp.org/2015/proset/">Proset/Projective Set</a> - A variant of set.  
* <a href="https://www.pagat.com/adders/24.html">24</a> - A game where you practice mental-arithmetic. I prefer to leave in face cards as 11,12,13, although this does mean you'll have more 'no solution' combinations.
* Spot It/Dobble - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTDKqW_GLkw&ab_channel=Stand-upMaths">Here's</a> a nice video by Matt Parker on the math behind the game, and how there's a couple cards missing!

**Other board games I like sometimes**
* 7 Wonders
* Splendor
* Azul

* Bughouse - team chess; admittedly the set of people for whom this is a good rec, and who also haven't played it is probably empty

## TV Shows
I often watch TV shows (or listen to them using Netflix audio descriptions) while doing other things.
### Comedy
* Brooklyn Nine-Nine - If you like sitcoms, this should be at the top of your list.
* Nathan for you/The Rehearsal - Two of my favorite shows on this page. In the former, Nathan Fielder gives 'unorthodox' marketing ideas to small businesses. The latter is a ride of it's own.
* Bojack Horseman - Dark, depressing, witty satire. 
* Crazy Ex-Girlfriend - A lighthearted musical romcom/satire. The musical element to the show works surprisingly well.
* 30 Rock - A lighthearted sitcom by Tina Fey and Donald Glover.
* Ted Lasso - My favorite currently-running sitcom. Jason Sudeikis is well-revered American football coach who's hired to be manager of a British football (soccer) team.
* Schitt's Creek - lighthearted sitcom/drama. I didn't love this show as much as some people, but for people who are big into sitcoms like modern family, friends, and the like; this is one of the better recent ones IMO.

* How To with John Wilson - Executive Produced by Nathan Fielder, similar-ish in style to the other two shows.

### Drama
* Master of None - A romantic comedy drama. I really love this show (at least seasons 1-2); give it a try if you're looking for something lighthearted.
* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul - Both dark, but very engaging. If you've seen Breaking Bad and liked it but haven't tried Better Call Saul, you should.
* The Queen's Gambit - Coming-of-age/historical drama. I'm biased here, but hard to argue with the 96% on Rotten Tomatoes. The scenary in the show is particularly entrancing. Some small overdramatizations when it comes to the chess, but not as egregious as most media of its kind.
* Atlanta - Cerebral drama. Donald Glover is a manager for his cousin trying to make it in the Atlanta rap game. This show certainly tries to do a lot; I won't say much more, but it certainly takes you for a (progressively trippier) ride.
* Barry - dark comedy drama. Bill Hader is a depressed hitman who ends up taking acting classes.
* Patriot - dark comedy drama. John is a depressed but competent undercover agent. 
* Fleabag - dry comedy drama. If you like british comedy, this is a short series you'll probably enjoy.
* The Leftovers - sci-fi drama. I've seen a lot of sci-fi/dystopian dramas and this was definitely one of the better ones. Took me a couple episodes to get into it.
* Game of Thrones - I waited until the last season was airing to watch this show, so I wasn't very excited for it. I think that it wasn't really my type of show, but I still liked it. If you've held out watching it and don't mind some blood/gore, there's a reason why it was everywhere for 8 years.
* House of Cards - An intricate political drama. One of those shows where if you pay attention, there are some big payoffs. I think the first couple seasons are the best. No longer a Spacey fan, this is just a rec for the show.
* Community - A classic sitcom. If you're a sitcom person and you like other sitcoms on this list, here you go.

### Action/Adventure
* Daredevil - I watched the MCU shows so you don't have to. This is the best one; if you need to watch one more, I'd recommend Jessica Jones.
* Legion - Okay this is a psychological thriller, but still a superhero series! I don't remember much about this show to be honest, but I wrote it on my recs list so if you want a superhero show it's probably not a bad pick.
* Avatar the last Airbender/The Legend of Korra - Fantasy coming-of-age stories. If you like Avatar as a kid, Legend of Korra is similar but for slightly older audiences, and I enjoyed it a couple of years ago.
* Stranger Things - sci-fi drama; I'm sure you've heard of it, but I'm listing it here anyway. Breakfast Club vibes.

### Other
* Black Mirror - Cerebral Anthology series. The episodes vary a lot in quality, in my opinion. I would start out with *White Christmas*, *Hated in the Nation*, and *San Junipero*.
* McMillion$ - True docu-series about how the McDonald's Monopoly promotion was rigged by the mob
* Chernobyl - Historical drama based on true events surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear disaster. Not framed as a docu-series, as engaging as any fictional drama. Highly critically-acclaimed.
* The Final Table - A cooking show with terrible reviews (? I didn't know this until I looked it up just now). I don't normally like/watch cooking shows, but I liked this one when I watched it. Maybe I just have bad taste...

**Other shows I've enjoyed but for various reasons wouldn't go so far as to recommend**

## Habits
### Write things down
I do this on my phone in Obsidian, although for ~7 years I used ColorNote, which is simpler to use and normally sufficient.

I think this is my best habit that most people don't have.
* Miscellaneous - Keep a notes file on your phone where you write down any thoughts/ideas you have that you think are worth remembering. Things like: fun facts you learn, an app idea you have, a question you wish you knew the answer to, a puzzle someone gives you that you haven't solved. You can make more granular notes, but that adds work; I recommend at least one 'catch-all' file where you can write important things down as easily as possible.
* Moment Journaling - I have an alarm for 11pm where every day I write down ~1-3 bullets (occasionally more) about the most important things that happened to me that day. I've tried journaling before and it's fallen off, but this is easy enough that I've kept up with it for over a year and I expect to keep doing it forever. It's easy for time to fly by, this helps you remember what's happened, and helps give you some context on how you've been changing over timme.
* Logging Exercise - so you can more easily see progress/patterns over time, and have reference points for exercises you don't do super regularly. I do this in a notepad on my phone
* At work: maintain a Google doc or other text file that you write down notes in so you can ctrl+f later. I keep a separate doc for programming so that I can search for syntax and other little things I've written down in the past.
* Other note files I have on my phone include: Recs for Others, Recs from Others, Dreams, Gifts, Inspirational, Vacation/travel/date ideas, Think to Sleep (things to think about when trying to fall asleep).
* Whenever I go to an event like a conference or long talk that I care about, I often make a dedicated note for it.
  
### Other Productivity
* Multi-tasking with audio - Not for everyone, but I do lots of things (exercising, doing chores, mindless games, walking places) while listening to Netflix using their English with Audio Descriptions setting (they don't have this for every show, but for many including all Netflix original Series; Hulu and other services have also been adding this) podcasts, YouTube videos that don't have important video, or audiobooks. 
* Look for podcast versions of things you'd otherwise read (ex. Astral Codex Ten Podcast on Spotify! Lesswrong Curated Podcast/Nonlinear library, etc.)
* Get 2 of things that you'll probably get more of eventually anyway, or for things where having 2 is better. For example, getting a backup phone-charger in case you lose or break your existing one. Getting a backup pair of the earbuds you like using, especially if they're cheap and you often misplace them (you can do the cost-benefit of how much time you'd save from not-searching for a thing when you've lost it, when you'd randomly find it without searching later on). I have a second clothes hamper so that after doing my laundry, I don't[^1] put dirty clothes on the floor while the other one has clean clothes in it.
* If you want to improve at something that involves motor skills, try doing it for short periods of time regularly. For example: improving typing skills, solving Rubik's cubes, juggling, or even exercises like pull-ups, push ups etc.
* If you want to work through a textbook and solve problems, and you don't want to carry around/lose track of that work in various notebooks or sheets of paper, etc. I recommend using an iPad, where you can open a pdf or book etc. on half the screen and a note-taking app on the other half. I put pdf files on Google drive then import them to the native Books app, and use Notability (free) for note-taking. I considered alternatives like the Remarkable and other tablets, including a kindle that I bought (I like eink), but none of them had the functionality I wanted. See the exact iPad version I recommend/pencil/case in my items section.

## Items
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3U5xRHI">Shockz headphones</a> - these 'bone conduction' headphones don't go over your ears, so you can hear the outside world as normal, but you can also hear the audio pretty well. I find most earbuds either extremely uncomfortable, or they just fall out of my ears. (The only pair of earbuds that don't hurt/fall out are these <a href="https://amzn.to/3T354lS">Sony wired earbuds</a> that I've bought ~15 pairs of over the last 10 years.)
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3Tk9rsZ">Adjustable dumbbells</a> - There are cheaper versions out there, but I've used these for a few years and they work well and are easy to change settings on. Makes it much easier to have a compact home gym. I also recommend getting a cheap weight bench.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3DBbin9">A doorway pull-up bar</a> - To complete your home gym. I've had one in the doorway to my kitchen for a couple years and doing 1 pull-up every time I go through the doorway made me get way better at pull-ups very quickly.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3E2FiK7">Miracle Fruit Tablets</a> - Like hallucinogenics for your taste-buds. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O8WG0d9jaY&ab_channel=WeirdExplorer">Here's</a> a history and video-review of the fruit by a youtuber that I like. Pretty interesting.
* Humidifier - If you live somewhere dry. I grew up in Florida and never had humidity issues, but since moving to the northeast using one of these has saved me. I also use <a href="https://amzn.to/3fBl6ph">these</a> to help keep it from growing mold. They don't work perfectly, but reduce the cleaning frequency by a lot.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3DZTiEx">Blender</a> with shaker-cup attachments for protein shakes/smoothies - I use my blender very regularly to make protein shakes, and it's a huge life improvement to have the cup attachments - saves a ton of cleaning time and I almost always only want that amount anyway.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3zIcHae">Fitbit</a> - I started using one of these a year ago and think it's worth having. It saves me a few minutes of time every day when checking the time/weather. It has a vibrating alarm you can use if you don't want to wake up a significant other or roommate. It tracks your heart rate/exercise and links with apps like Strava. It tracks how much you sleep and how restful your sleep is.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3SYSMLj">Tungsten cube</a> - This (expensive) 1.5 inch cube is almost certainly heavier per unit volume than anything else of its size that you've held. Holding it is just surprising, and makes you contemplate how gravity is really a force. It surprises others whenever I give it to them to hold, and that gives me joy. Made popular by <a href="https://thume.ca/2019/03/03/my-tungsten-cube/">Tristan Hume's blog post</a>, which gives a longer description and his justification for the purchase.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3U8K4eS">Zojirushi Rice Cooker</a> - When I moved to NYC and went to purchase things to fill my apartment, I almost bought a cheap Oster rice cooker like the one my family's always used. I'd heard that Zojirushi Rice Cookers are worth it despite being expensive, so I treated myself and spent the extra money. It's always made me amazing rice, and plays a happy little tune that makes me smile whenever it's done cooking. :)
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3sW69B4">Nishiki Rice</a> - I use this rice in my rice cooker, even though it's a little more expensive than other rice.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3FLDbvG">Zojirushi Water Boiler</a> - If you're a fan of Zojirushi products and you often make tea or pasta, this water boiler keeps you almost-boiling water available immediately all the time. If you like making pasta, having one of these speeds up the process considerably. Science point - you leave this plugged in all the time, but it doesn't take tons of extra energy to do so, since you basically just have to heat up the water and keep it relatively insulated, then it just takes a little bit of energy to keep it hot! Credit to Adam Canady for recommending this to me in the context of efficient-pasta-making.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3U5ZnF2">De Cecco Penne Pasta (12 lbs)</a> - Speaking of efficient-pasta-making, I buy this De Cecco penne in bulk and store it in my closet. It's very cheap per meal and makes amazing pasta. I make a lot of it at once and store it in my fridge with a little olive oil, then use different pasta sauces for each leftover meal and it's great.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3U02Wwp">Brita Filter faucet attachment</a> - I pretty stronger prefer carbon-filtered water. Brita filters are kind of annoying to refill constantly; this faucet attachment gives you nicely filtered water on tap.
* Computer Wrist Rest - I like <a href="https://amzn.to/3T8Sp0u">this one</a>, but probably other ones are good. Makes a noticable difference on the strain I get from using my computer for long periods of time.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3U9hxWj">Quaker Simply Granola Oats</a> - I like this granola in greek yogurt.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3FGKfcS">Keyboard: Leopold FC980C 30g (Compact Topre Switches)</a> - Obviously very expensive keyboard, but I own a few mechanical keyboards and this one is by far my favorite. The keys are very light and it's very satisfying to type on. If you're a keyboard enthusiast,  consider giving it a try.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3WyBLKD">Blood Type Kit</a> - I didn't know my blood type, now I do[^2], and you can too!
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3h25uvg">Tournament Chess Set</a> - If you play chess but don't have a set, I recommend getting this one, and not a cheaper knock-off from Amazon. I bought a set that looked just like this on the item page, but then it was unexpectedly 3/4th size. I have 2 sets for bughouse.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3WpN0oK">Outlet splitter</a> - Never run out of outlets ever again.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3DDEfz1">CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion for Itch Relief</a> - I normally hate the feeling of oily lotion and related things, but I occasionally get itchy dry skin on my elbow, and this is by far the best thing for it out of everything I tried, both for relief and for recovery.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3h91byq">Blistex lip ointment</a> - If you ever get chapped lips in the winter, this stuff is just way better than anything else I've used. I put on a little bit of this and chapstick on top of it and my lips get unchapped very quickly.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3E2OjTv">Microwave Cover</a> - If you microwave things, and they splatter, you can use this to save yourself some cleaning.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3U9jWQP">Shower Curtain Weights</a> - If your shower curtain gets sucked in and sticks to you when you shower (Bernoulli's principle!), you can get these weights to help.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3zLAHti">T-Shirts for Men</a> - I really like these tees. They're comfy, have a good fit/cut, are pretty cheap, and are plain in nice colors. (They also make <a href="https://amzn.to/3t6uNPv">shirts for women,</a> but I can't personally vouch for their quality.)
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3WweMA3">Comfy towel set</a> - I use these towels and I think they're very comfy.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3sYwfn0">OWYN Chocolate Protein Shakes (vegan)</a> - By far the best vegan protein shakes I've ever had. They're a little expensive, but other vegan protein powder/shakes I've tried are just much worse.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3Wwr7nO">Balega Socks</a> - Maybe you have no need for very nice socks, but if you do (and are willing to pay $20 for a pair of socks), these are really comfy socks. I bought ~10 different specialty sock brands (mostly catered to runners), and these were clearly the best.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3E1t4kN">Used Apple iPad Pro 12.9-in. 3rd generation</a> - This is the only Apple product I've purchased for myself, I'm an Android/Windows guy. That said, after much research, it's just clearly the best tool for reading e-textbooks while also taking notes side-by-side. For most use-cases, the Pro 12.9-in. 3rd generation is the model you want. You can get it used for relatively cheap, and the models have not improved by much since then.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3E1DPni">Apple Pencil (2nd gen)</a> - For note-taking while reading etc. I initially got a knock-off Apple pencil for $30, but it's much less consistent syncing/randomly disconnects and has worse battery-life, so maybe actually get a regular one.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3TmCEn7">iPad Case</a> - This is a really good/cheap case. Has space for the pencil, and it's very easy to take out of the spot. The charger-hole works well (some other cases are surprisingly bad at this).
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3fEbQ3N">Collapsible Laundry Hamper</a> - I have 2 copies of this $7 hamper.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3FIX6er">GAN 11 M Pro, 3x3 Magnetic Speed Cube</a> - This is basically the best Rubik's cube. Also expensive (cheaper GAN models are also probably good), but if you decide you want to speed cube, it's the one to get. One friend I recommended it to cut 25% off his time by using it instead of his old cube.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3FGOHIC">'Greenies' Dog Treats</a> - These are my dog's favorite treats. He begs for them every evening at the same time. He's addicted.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3WACHy8">Shoe Balancer/Leveler</a> - If you ever injure your foot/ankle and need to use a medical boot, wearing one of these on your other shoe will balance out your height. Actually made a huge quality-of-life difference for me.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3DBEMl2">Digital Bathroom Scale</a> - If you're trying to build muscle or diet, it's helpful to have a scale for a feedback mechanism. I'm sure basically any such scale is good; I just know this one works.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3G3sO6D">Ice Cream Scoop</a> - Instead of bending your spoons and hurting your palm, this pointy ice-cream scoop works well.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3E4prLg">Groove Belt</a> - A stretchy stylish(?) belt that's very adjustable and made from nylon and aluminum.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/3T93ZJ0">JBL Flip Speaker</a> - Surprisingly loud waterproof speaker. Great for listening to things in the shower, outside, for a party, etc.
 
## Other
* Escape Rooms - Sometimes I think: "What's a good random thing to do today, where I have nothing planned but people who I should _do a thing_ with?" A couple times when I've had this thought, we've done an escape room, and it's never felt like a mistake. 
* Consider using a laundry service. If you dislike doing laundry/find it inconvenient/live somewhere services are cheap especially. It's like $15 per load of laundry where I live, and they even fold it for you. If you aren't used to doing cost/benefit calculations, here's your practice problem.
* YouTube Premium - If you're like me and watch a lot of YouTube videos, you probably also watch a lot of YouTube ads. Youtube premium is $10/month ($7 for students, $23 for a 5-member family plan, and free for the first 3 months, at least when I'm writing this), so you can do the math on expected-time-saved vs. cost and decide if it's worth it for you.
* Audio Illusions - People are used to optical illusions, but there are also a great array of audio illusions out there. The classic is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X_WvGAhMlQ&ab_channel=GuardianNews">Yanny/Laurel</a>, but there's also, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXxV2C1ri2k&ab_channel=GuardianNews">Green Needle/Brainstorm</a>. I've come back to these and heard both phrases and it absolutely blows my mind. Really shows how much your brain messes with/processes raw sensory input. Here's a couple other effects - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY6h3pKqYI0&t=59s&ab_channel=MonotoneTim">Auditory Illusions: Hearing Lyrics Where There Are None</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCLyi8bdBA&ab_channel=CaseyConnor">infinitely rising/falling pitches</a>.
* <a href="http://www.fun-with-words.com/">fun-with-words.com</a> - I ran across this site as a young lad and loved it. A great little reference for a few fun types of wordplay.
* Converting youtube videos to .mp3 - If you edit a youtube url by adding 'pi' after the 'youtube' (i.e. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ becomes https://www.youtubepi.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ ) it takes you to a website where you can download the video or the audio from the video. I've found this useful for downloading covers of songs that I like so I can then add them to Spotify or my phone or whatever. Similar for youtube videos that are basically podcasts, etc.
