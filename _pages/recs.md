## Habits

Write things down - 
* Write down thoughts you have that you think are worth saving
* Moment Journaling so you remember your life
* Dream Journaling (literal/metaphorical) - apparently staying intentional mostly a matter of writing goals down
* Logging Exercise so you can see progress over time
* Multi-tasking with netflix audio description/podcasts/audiobooks
* On that note; looking for podcast versions of things you'd otherwise read (ex. Astral Codex Ten Podcast on Spotify!)
* Try things regularly (i.e. pull-ups in doorways)
* Getting 2 of (some) things (laundry hamper, charger, for example)

## Misc.
* Shockz headphones
* Adjustable dumbbells
* A doorway pull-up bar
* Humidifier
* Blender for protein shakes/smoothies
* fitbit
* Tungsten cube
* lesswrong
