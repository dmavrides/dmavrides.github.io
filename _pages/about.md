I'm currently working as a quant trader and researcher in New York. I graduated from Princeton in 2019 with a Mathematics degree, minoring in Computer Science. 

Here are some things contained on this website:
(these mostly currently under construction)
* Information about my academic/professional life
* Information about my personal life
* A collection of recommendations of various kinds
* A collection of blog posts and shorter-form thoughts

You can reach me at dylan dot mavrides at gmail.
