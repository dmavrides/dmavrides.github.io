## Publications
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09672#">The 2-associahedra are Eulerian</a> (2019) with Nathaniel Bottman; submitted to Contemporary Mathematics (Ezra Getzler Festschrift).
Expands on the work in my thesis, showing the 2-associahedra are Eulerian lattices.

<a href="https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01bc386n05q">2-Associahedra are Eulerian Posets</a> (2019) my senior thesis, advised by Noga Alon and Nathaniel Bottman.
Provides combinatorial background and introduction to 2-associahedra, then proves they are Eulerian posets

## Other Academic Projects
<a href="https://dmavrides.github.io/files/Draft_2__Junior_Independent_Work.pdf"> Investigations into the Existence and Centralization of Equilibria in Bitcoin-like Auctions</a> (2018) junior independent work, advised by Matthew Weinberg and Jon Fickenscher.
Generalization of Weinberg and Arnostiâ€™s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08572"> Bitcoin: A Natural Oligopoly</a>. His paper investigated the nature of equilibria in Bitcoin-like
settings, concluding that small cost asymmetries and other changes result in Nash Equilibria where at most
only a small number of agents choose to invest.

<a href="https://dmavrides.github.io/files/Algorithms_final_project.pdf"> Making Fantasy Football Predictions Using Multiplicative Weights </a> (2017) final project for graduate algorithms class, with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ericneyman/">Eric Neyman</a> and Rachel Andrew Wonnacott.
