Here's some basic advice from a medicre speedcuber[^1].

<a href="https://amzn.to/3FIX6er">GAN 11 M Pro, 3x3 Magnetic Speed Cube</a> - 
This is basically the best Rubik's cube. 
Also expensive (cheaper GAN models are also probably good), but if you decide you want to speed cube and have the spare money, it's the one to get[^2] 

## Beginner
I recommend learning to solve the cube using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ron6MN45LY&ab_channel=JPerm">this</a> tutorial.

This requires learning 5 algorithms (6 if you count a mirrored-version as a separate one) that are 7-moves-long on average.[^3]

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24eHm4ri8WM&ab_channel=JPerm">Here's a video guide</a> to Rubik's cube notation.

## Getting Faster
After you can solve the cube comfortably, you should watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmsUcTl1MOQ&ab_channel=CubeAddct">this video</a> on 
the 'keyhole method', which should shave off a lot of your time, and help you gain some intuition for the main solving
method that speedcubers use: 'Fridrich f2l' (first 2 layers).

The below pieces of advice are ongoing, and you should feel free to practice them while simultaneously learning the 'intermediate' technique below.
* You should also learn to solve the first layer on the bottom of the cube, instead of solving it on the top and flipping the cube over.
* Practice using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLuVF9Dk3AQ&ab_channel=JPerm">'finger tricks'</a> - i.e. using just your fingers to turn the faces of the cube, and never your whole hand.
* Practice avoiding 'cube rotations' as much as possible.
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw3DpueJsWM&ab_channel=JPerm">Practice look ahead</a>
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rubik%27s+cube+cross+practice">Solve the cross faster</a>

## Intermediate
Learn Fridrich or 'intuitive' f2l <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ar_Zit1VLG0&t=53s&ab_channel=JPerm">here</a>.
This technique doesn't require you learn any algorithms for the first two layers, and is very fast. Along with some extra
tricks, it's the main technique for solving that almost all modern speedcubers use.

To solve the last layer, I recommend learning 2-look OLL and 2-look PLL first.
OLL stands for 'orienting the last layer' i.e. orienting the pieces so that yellow (or whatever opposite-cross color you use)
is on top. PLL stands for 'permuting the last layer' i.e. moving around the pieces so that they're in the correct spots.

I use <a href="https://cubingcheatsheet.com/algs3x_2loll.html">these</a> 2L OLL algs, and <a href="https://cubingcheatsheet.com/algs3x_2lpll.html">these</a> 2LPLL algs. 

#### Lefty 2-look PLL Algs
I also solve one-handed lefty and use the following alternative PLL algs: 
  * a: R2 U' R' U' R U R U R U' R
  * b: z U2 R U R U' R' U' R' U' R U' z'
  * z: y (R' U' R U) (R U R U') (R' U R U) R2 U' R' [U2]
  * h: R2 U2' R U2' R2 U2' R U2' R2

## Advanced
Here are some more advanced techniques:

* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9POsBAaKd0&ab_channel=JPerm">X-Cross</a>

  Talks about various advanced techniques.

[^1]: Me. Except really I'm just linking to a ton of JPerm's videos, and he is not mediocre.
[^2]: One friend I recommended it to cut 25% off his time by using it instead of his old cube.
[^3]: Each move in one of these algorithms is twisting one of 4 faces (the traditional beginner algorithms don't use the back or bottom faces) clockwise or counterclockwise.
So that's 7*5=35 moves * 8 options / 10 digits = 28 digits. I.e. to solve a Rubik's cube is basically like memorizing a single 28 digit number.
Except I'm sure the entropy is much lower since the twists are mostly with only two of the faces. But you also need to learn some intuitive non-algorithmic steps.
[^4]: actually 6, because of a fluke mistake by the tournament organizers
