## Context
First, a short story:

I dislike many more fruits than most people. I probably hadn't had a smoothie since I was a young child until a friend 
- who is an even pickier eater than me - said he had started having them daily and it was life changing. He said it's had the most positive impact on his life per emount of effort of anything he's ever done. (They actually taste good, they're actually healthy so you feel good about yourself for having them, and they help you feel physically better - or at least act as a pretty believable placebo.)

After hearing that, I was pretty convinced that it would be stupid of me to not at least try making some smoothies to see if
I happened to have the same extremely positive experience. So of course I bought all the ingredients to make a smoothie, and
literally stood in the kitchen a couple times intending to make one, then somehow it didn't happen. There's some weird
mental hurdle there that I haven't quite come to terms with, but anyway - eventually he visited New York and the social
pressure got to me. I've basically stuck to the exact same recipe that I used the second time I made one, and I've made
them very regularly since then.

## Recipe
I use the cup-attachment on my Ninja blender. Pro tip: I often put the cup and blendy-bit in the freezer for a few 
minutes before making the smoothie, this definitely keeps it slushier/less liquidy when making it.

Then I put in the following ingredients in this order:
* 6[^1] frozen blackberries
* 5 frozen raspberries
* 3 frozen cherries
* 2 large spoonfuls of (0% milkfat Fage) greek yogurt
* 1 scoop of <a href="https://amzn.to/3VkZPj5">(Gold Standard Double Rich) Chocolate protein powder</a>
* 1 spoonful <a href="https://amzn.to/3GmYtQk">(Terrasoul) golden ground flax</a>
* 3-5g creatine (sometimes; definitely more optional than anything else on this list)
* A little bit of milk (or soy milk) - really less than you think you'd need if you like your smoothies thick and you put
enough greek yogurt in it. Maybe half a cup?
* 5 leaves of frozen spinach[^2]

I then blend it until I think it's blended the berries sufficiently well. Blending it more will make it more liquidy/less
icy. I often blend for ~5-10s, then shake the cup a few times, then blend for another 5-10s.



[^1]: No I'm not super anal about putting in the same number every time or anything like that, this is just my best guess at the average.

[^2]: This is an amount that you both can't taste and also that probably has no real health impact. But if the alterative is none, then I figure I might as well get whatever placebo effects I can out of it/desensitize myself to the idea of eating spinach at the very least.
