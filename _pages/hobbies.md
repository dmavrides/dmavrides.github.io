Here is a list of some of my hobbies and skills, along with my rough skill level/experience.
**Sports**
* Bouldering - V4 climber. Started January 2022 but broke my ankle in March. Back into it!
* Weight lifting - Largely replaced by bouldering, but I can still bench my body weight and try to do PPL when feeling motivated enough. I log all my sessions, and have gone to the gym 419 between 8/2019 and 10/2022.
* Jogging - Started in 2021. This is painful and I'm bad at it, but I keep trying. Could jog 5k in <30mins, and once jogged a loop around Central Park.
