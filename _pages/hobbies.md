Here is a list of some of my hobbies and skills, along with my rough skill level/experience.
** Sports
* Bouldering - V4 climber. Started January 2022 but broke my ankle in March. Back into it!
* Weight lifting - Largely replaced by bouldering, but I can still bench my body weight and try to do PPL when feeling motivated enough. I log all my sessions, and have gone to the gym 419 between 8/2019 and 10/2022.
* Jogging - Started in 2021. This is painful and I'm bad at it, but I keep trying. Could jog 5k in <30mins, and once jogged a loop around Central Park.

** Games
* Chess - Currently ~2100 lichess on all time controls. Started playing freshman year of high school, tied 3rd-place in 11th grade k-12 nationals; won various local tournaments.
* BeatSaber - S most Expert/many Expert+ songs
* Overwatch - GM/t500 peak
* Storybook Brawl - Mythic/4600 peak
* Tetris - 40L in 80s on <a href="https://jstris.jezevec10.com/">jstris</a>, used to ST-stack in fb tetris battle
* dominion - $$\mu=.5$$ on <a href="https://dominion.games/">dominion.games</a>
