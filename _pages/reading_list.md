This list represents my current personal library/reading list. 
Some I'm reading, some I haven't started, all I hope to read (at least portions of) eventually.
A few I've read/used a while ago but would like to go through them again.
Many of these are from various 'best textbook' lists, or have been personally recommended to me.

If you have recs of your own, please share them with me!
{% include toc %}
## Fiction
* The Three-Body Problem (Liu Cixin) - Originally written in Chinese but was translated and won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2015 anyway. 
* Anathem (Stephenson)
* Never Let Me Go (Ishiguro)
* Dies the Fire (Stirling)
* HPMOR (Yudkowsky)

## Nonfiction/Textbooks
### Philosophy
Mostly philosophy of science/reasoning.

* Quantum Computing Since Democritus (Scott Aaronson) - A whirlwind of mathematical and philosophical explorations into topics including quantum effects, randomness, interactive proofs, the anthropic principle, free will, time travel, and more.
* Probability Theory, The Logic of Science (Jaynes) - This book does its best to teach you how to think and how to do science.
* The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Kuhn)
* Replacing Guilt (Soares)
* The Mind's I (Hofstadter and Dennett)
* Rationality from AI to Zombies (Yudkowsky)
* Inadequate Equilibria (Yudkowsky)

### Math
* An Infinitely Large Napkin (Chen)
* The Mathematical Mechanic (Levi) - A book that shows how you can use physical intuition to solve math problems.
* GÃ¶del, Escher, Back: An Eternal Golden Braid (Hofstadter)
* Graph Theory, A Problem Oriented Approach (Marcus) - A simple little book that teaches you graph theory exclusively by having you work through problems.
* God Created the Integers (Hawking) - Runs through a history of mathematics via brief biographies and an anthology with portions of original works by many mathematicians including Euclid, Newton, Gaus, Galois, Godel, and Turing.
* Calculus (Spivak)
* Calculus of Variations (Gelfand & Fomin)
* Linear Algebra Done Right (Axler)
* Linear Algebra (Shilov)
* Analysis I (Tao)
* Complex Analysis (Stein & Shakarchi) - This is a good textbook.
* Analytic Combinatorics (Flajolet)
* Basic Algebra (Knapp)
* Abstract Algebra (Dummit & Foote)
* Category Theory (Awodey)
* A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory (Ireland & Rosen)
* Topology (Munkres) - This is a great book. It includes an introduction to set theory, and does a wonderful job introducing the reader to topology. The textbook practice problems are a wonderful set of puzzles.
* Algebraic Topology (Hatcher)
* generatingfunctionology (Wilf)
* The Probabilistic Method (Alon and Spencer)
* Introduction to Statistical Inference (Kiefer)
* Bayesian Data Analysis (Gelman)
* The Art of Problem Solving Volumes 1&2 (Rusczyk & Lehoczky) - One day I'll learn competition math, I've heard working through these books is a good way to get good at problem solving. It's never too late.
* A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics (Carr) - I heard that if you study this book diligently, you might become a mathematics prodigy
* Pillow Problems and A Tangled Tale (Carroll)

### Computer Science
* Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen)
* Mathematics and Computation (Wigderson) - An intuition-based introduction to computational complexity theory
* Computational Geometry (de Berg, Cheong, van Kreveld, Overmars)
* Cracking the Coding Interview (McDowell)

### Science
#### Physics
* On the Shoulders of Giants (Hawking) - Stephen Hawking walks through the history of physics and astronomy with a series of biographies and critical essays on the likes of Newton and Einstein, accompanied by their most famous works themselves.
* The Feynman Lectures in Physics (Feynman)
* Statistical Physics (Landau and Lifshitz)
* Electricity and Magnetism (Purcell & Morin)
* Principles of General Thermodynamics (Hatsopoulos & Keenan)
* Modern Quantum Mechanics (Sakurai & Napolitano)
* Group Theory and Physics (Sternberg)

#### Chemistry
* Napoleon's Buttons (LeCouteur & Burreson) - A series of 17 stories, each of which centers on how a particular molecule played a significant role in shaping history

#### Biology
* Essential Cell Biology (Alberts, Bray, Hopkin, Johnson, Lewis, Raff, Roberts, Walter)

### Other
#### Chess
* Silman's Complete Endgame Course (Silman)
* Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual (Dvoretsky)
#### Miscellaneous
* The Precipice (Ord)
* Thinking, Fast and Slow (Kahneman)
* Sadly, Porn (Teach) - I purchased this after reading <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-sadly-porn">Scott Alexander's review</a>
