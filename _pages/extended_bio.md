This is an extended bio that includes more personal details about my life. 
I'm not trying to make this interesting, or useful to read. Sorry in advance if you read it then think it was a waste of time.

**Early Life**
I was born in Winter Park, Florida on March 22, 1997 about 6 weeks premature. 
The earliest memory I have that's easy to date was about a week before my 4th birthday.
I remember sitting in a shopping cart, waiting in the checkout line, and my mom said I was turning 4 soon. 
I insisted that I didn't want to turn 4. She said there wasn't anything I could do about it, and I responded by saying
that if I can't stay 3, I'll at least keep telling people that I'm 3. One of my other earliest memories is me sitting in the
back seat in a car with my Dad. He said that memory is strange; that we forget almost everything that happens passively, but
if you try to remember something (or try to forget it, or otherwise draw attention to it), you probably will. He illustrated
this by saying "watching, you won't be able to forget this now that I've said it," and indeed, I haven't.

I started grade school at Brookshire Elementary. I remember elementary school as relatively happy, but classes as boring. My favorite class
was 5th grade science, where we did weekly science experiments. That year I was also on a team that won the Elementary Division
of the Florida Science Olympiad. When I was very young, a neighbor across the street gave me a box of Pok√©mon cards. 
I spent a lot of my childhood collecting the cards, watching the TV show, and playing the video games. I was also an avid reader.
My parents didn't want me playing video games much as a child, but I got them to agree to give me more daily time if I broke
the school's Accelerated Reader (AR) record. This is basically a system where if you read a book, you can take a short
test and get some points that accumulate throughout the school year. I read a lot of books, broke the record, and got to
play a little bit more Pokemon Silver, Super Mario Land, and fish tycoon.
